# Firebase

We will be using the same firebase project created by Will.

To access the Firebase Console, reach out to `C0dingViking` with your google email and ask him to add you to the project.

## Firestore Access

To access the firestore from your local machine you must add the `shared-debug.keystore` files shared on discord to `concordia_campus_guide/android/app/debug/`.
